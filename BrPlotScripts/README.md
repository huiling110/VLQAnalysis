# Brendan's Plotting Scripts

These plotting scripts use python developer tools and require a python virtual environment.

## Virtual Environment Instructions

From the CMSSW src directory, the python modules can be updated to latest versions in a python virtual environment. A shell script is included to streamline this process. This script will also open the venv if it already exists.

```bash
# First make sure that there is a directory to store python virtual environments. If there is not, then make one
mkdir /path/to/venvs
source ./setup_plotEnv.sh /path/to/venvs
```
